# Crop_Disease_Detection

Dataset Used: PlantVillage Dataset (Labeled)
Healthy and diseased images of five crops are taken into consideration which are apple, corn, grape, potato and tomato containing 31,397 images. The images of 5 crops species were classified into 25 classes. Among these 25 classes, 20 classes contain diseased images and 5 classes contain healthy images. Segmented and gray-scale images are generated for each image and then the dataset is partitioned into three portions for color, gray-scale and segmented images. Overall, the dataset contains a total of 94,191 images.

I have worked on the Segmented Images using the CNN Arcgitecture. 

Accuracy Achieved : 83.4%
